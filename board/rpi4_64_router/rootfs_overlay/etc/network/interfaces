# Note the below manual commands are intended to simulate what happens with

#     iface eth0 inet6 auto
#             accept_ra 2
#             dhcp 1
#             request_prefix 1
# Except that ifupdown currently provides no way to specify the
# --prefix-len-hint argument to dhclient. So this manual method adds the prefix
# length hint, and also leaves out some other unnecessary steps.
#
# With my testing on comcast, I requested a /56 but it gave me a /60, but that
# will still work for my purposes.
